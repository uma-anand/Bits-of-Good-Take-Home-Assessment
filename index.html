                <h1>Hi! I'm Uma Anand.</h1>
                <hr>
                <p>I'm a first-year computer science major (although I do enjoy the ever so occasional shower) from Chennai, India. I love interacting with people and helping them. I helped tutor students for the SATs in high school, and in the spring semester, I will be working with the College of Computing as a peer tutor. I have also previously worked with the <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.teachforindia.org/">Teach For India Foundation</a> to teach English to underprivileged children in rural parts of India, and I loved being a part of their learning process and watching them grow.</p>
                <p>In my free time, I pursue a myriad of various hobbies (though whether I'm good at any of them is a different question). I've dabbled in advanced surfing, high-altitude trekking, rock climbing, improvisational humor, and the violin. I love reading, and my task for this year is to finish <a target = "_blank" href = "https://entertainment.time.com/2005/10/16/all-time-100-novels/slide/all/"> Time Magazine's list of the <em>100 Greatest Novels of All Time</em></a> (I've finished 24 so far).</p>
